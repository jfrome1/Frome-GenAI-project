This project aims to promote a positive GenAI policy for writing-focused courses and to collect information about student use of GenAI for future research.

### We are inviting instructors to participate at their level of interest

- Team member (low-effort): You set a GenAI policy for your course that includes students submitting transcripts of their GenAI use. After the course ends, you provide us those transcripts for research.

- Co-PI: In addition to team member duties, you join the research team at a level we can decide together, with potential duties including designing the study, analyzing data, and presenting or publishing our findings.

### Details about joining

- Although we present a sample policy [here](/gen-ai-policy/), you can decide on a different GenAI policy for your course/section
- We will make a webpage you can show students that explains your policy and how students can most easily follow it
- Your students will turn in GenAI transcripts along with their assignments, but you don't need to do anything with them during the course
- You can opt to look at all, some, or none of the transcripts during the course, and can communicate your choice to your students
- Students will be told that their transcripts may be used for research, but that they can opt-out after their grades are delivered
- Transcripts will be anonymized before being used in research.
- We recommend that you make clear that students cannot opt-out of your GenAI course policy, only whether the transcripts they submit are analyzed for research purposes.
