title: Welcome to the NUS GenAI Policy Project

This project aims to promote a positive GenAI policy for writing-focused courses and to collect information about student use of GenAI for future research. In short, we are inviting instructors to allow student use of GenAI on the condition that they submit links to their chats for analysis.

Participating instructors will be allowed to set their own GenAI policy as appropriate for their classes.

### We are inviting instructors to participate at their level of interest

- Team member (low-effort): You set a GenAI policy for your course that includes students submitting links to their GenAI chats. After the course ends, we give students the option to opt-out of having their chats analyzed, and the remaining chats are analyzed for research.

- Co-PI: In addition to team member duties, you join the research team at a level we can decide together, after we know how many are interested in participating, with potential duties including helping design the study, analyzing data, and presenting or publishing our findings.

### Details about joining

- We have set up a student-facing GenAI policy site [here](https://nus-ai-writing-project.vercel.app/)
- The site will have a separate page for each participating course and section that explains your policy and how students can most easily follow it
- We recommend various [:best practices](#x-best) for implementing the policy.

### Instructor options

I'm happy to discuss policy options with instructors are interested in potentially joining the project. Instructors can specify policy options appropriate for their particular classes on their dedicated GenAI policy webpage on [the student-facing project website]](https://nus-ai-writing-project.vercel.app/). Options include:

- prohibiting certain uses of GenAI, such as a ban on submitting unrevised text produced by GenAI
- whether you will review (or will reserve the right to review) student chats before grading
- including an instructor declaration about your own possible GenAI use as recommended by the [NUS Policy for Use of AI in Teaching and Learning](https://ctlt.nus.edu.sg/ai-community-of-practice/policies/)

### How to participate

Just email me letting me know of your interest. In order to create a webpage for your section, I need to know:

- course code
- section or tutorial codes
- meeting times and locations

Once you send me this, I'll send you an email asking for you to choose several policy options. You will also be free to change any of the policy wording to suit you. Please see the sample policies on this site.

Feel free to invite instructors from other courses or institutions to join the project!

##### :x best

We have found that the following best practices will increase student compliance with the policy by making it easy for them to follow:

- Explain that we want to collect links to learn how students use GenAI, not for disciplinary purposes.
- Devote 10 minutes of class to having students create a ChatGPT account, have a short practice conversation, and send you the share link.
- Have the same GenAI policy for every assignment rather than just for major assignments.
- Require that all students submit a ChatGPT link with their first assignment, even if they don't really use GenAI for the assignment (they can just write "Hi GPT" into the chat)
- Clarify that students should submit all chats, even if they didn't use anything from the chat in their assignment
- Make it clear to students that they cannot opt-out of your GenAI course policy, only whether the transcripts they submit are later analyzed for research purposes

Once students submit their first link and understand that every assignment must have either a link or a non-use statement, compliance should remain high. If students forget to include the link or the statement, a brief note asking them to resubmit a corrected assignment can reinforce the message.

Finally, remember that 100% compliance isn't necessary for this project to be useful. Even if only 50% of students comply, you will still know a *lot* more about their GenAI use compared to not requesting links at all.

<!-- removed: - varying what you tell students about whether you will review their chats before grading, with some option being:
	- you won't look at the chats until after grades are in
	- you will look at chats only in cases where you have a good reason to
	- you reserve the right to look at chats for any reason -->
