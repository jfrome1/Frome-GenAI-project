title: Welcome to the NUS GenAI Policy Project

This project aims to promote a positive GenAI policy for writing-focused courses and to collect information about student use of GenAI for future research. In short, we are inviting instructors to allow student use of GenAI on the condition that they submit links to their chats for analysis.

Instructors will be given several options to customize the policy and process for their sections.

### We are inviting instructors to participate at their level of interest

- Team member (low-effort): You set a GenAI policy for your course that includes students submitting links to their GenAI chats (or transcripts, at your option). After the course ends, we analyze the chats (students are given the option to opt-out after grades are submitted).

- Co-PI: In addition to team member duties, you join the research team at a level we can decide together, after we know how many are interested in participating, with potential duties including helping design the study, analyzing data, and presenting or publishing our findings.

### Details about joining

- We have set up a student-facing GenAI policy site [here](https://nus-ai-writing-project.vercel.app/)
- The site will have a separate page for each participating section that explains your policy and how students can most easily follow it
- We recommend that you make it clear to students that they cannot opt-out of your GenAI course policy, only whether the transcripts they submit are analyzed for research purposes.

### Instructor options

I'll provide more details for those who want to join the project, but you can customize your policy in various ways, such as:

- prohibiting certain uses, such as a ban on submitting work entirely produced by GenAI
- options for what you tell students about whether you will or might look at the chats before grades are in, e.g.:
	- you won't look at the chats until after grades are in
	- you will look at chats only in cases where you have a good reason to
	- you reserve the right to look at chats for any reason
- including an instructor declaration about your own possible GenAI use as recommended by the [NUS Policy for Use of AI in Teaching and Learning](https://ctlt.nus.edu.sg/ai-community-of-practice/policies/)

### How to participate

Just email me letting me know of your interest. In order to create a webpage for your section, I need to know:

- course code
- section or tutorial codes
- meeting times and locations

Once you send me this, I'll send you an email asking for you to choose several policy options. You will also be free to change any of the policy wording to suit you. Please see the sample policies on this site.

Feel free to invite instructors from other courses to join the project!
