This project aims to promote a positive GenAI policy for writing-focused courses and to collect information about student use of GenAI for future research.

### We are inviting instructors to participate at their level of interest

- Team member (low-effort): You set a GenAI policy for your course that includes students submitting transcripts of their GenAI use. After the course ends, you provide us those transcripts for research.

- Co-PI: In addition to team member duties, you join the research team at a level we can decide together, with potential duties including designing the study, analyzing data, and presenting or publishing our findings.

### Details about joining

- Although we present a sample policy [here](/gen-ai-policy/), you can decide on a different GenAI policy for your course/section
- We will make a webpage you can show students that explains your policy and how students can most easily follow it
- Your students will turn in GenAI transcripts along with their assignments, but you don't need to do anything with them during the course
- You can opt to look at all, some, or none of the transcripts during the course, and can communicate your choice to your students
- Students will be told that their transcripts may be used for research, but that they can opt-out after their grades are delivered
- Transcripts will be anonymized before being used in research.
- We recommend that you make clear that students cannot opt-out of your GenAI course policy, only whether the transcripts they submit are analyzed for research purposes.

### FAQs

- Can I have my students copy and paste their chat into a document in Microsoft Word or Google Docs and submit that instead?

That's ok with me, but there are possible drawbacks. In short, copy/pasting each time requires effort that will lower compliance as compared to a class of students with the software installed. The question is whether the effort of installing software is more of a burden than copy/pasting transcripts.

 , and the resulting transcripts are more subject to formatting variation, which makes it much harder to process the data later. It's much easier if everyone captures the data in the same way.

This is an ongoing project and we are still figuring out the best ways to capture data. This term, (2024-25 Sem 1), I required my students all said that they didn't use GenAI on their first exercise. I'm going to require them to submit a downloaded transcript (just to make sure they have the software installed) before their second exercise, and I suspect I will see many transcripts for the next exercise.

Currently, we have Firefox and Convdown. Short term, we may write a Chrome plug-in for this purpose. Longer term, we hope to write a custom platform.


 First, I think student compliance will be much lower. It's a pain to copy/paste chats for every assignment, and even a small amount of friction can lead to low compliance when there is little direct benefit to the participant. The first time I asked for transcripts, in 2023-24 Semester 1, zero transcripts were submitted. I later found out (via email survey after grades were submitted) that about 70% of students did use GenAI in some form. They were willing to write me an email about their usage but not to copy/paste into a document.

Second, there is a chance that text will be missed in the copy/paste process. Third, it is important that all data be in a similar format for later processing. ChatGPT has changed its page format and copy/pasted transcripts are more vulnerable to these changes. During 2023-24 Semester 2, copy/pasted transcripts didn't include the heading indicating whether the text was an prompt (input) or a response (output). Today,
